# Bella Oter – Body Profile Experience (Portfolio Project)

This project simulates the introductory page of **Bella Oter**, a fictional wellness fashion brand. 
It is designed to be mobile-first, visually elegant, and responsive. 
This landing page allows visitors to choose what their body "craves today"—such as Grounding, Softness, Energy, or 
Freedom—each leading to a unique product collection.
